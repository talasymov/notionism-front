        This Cookie Policy explains how we uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our
        website at <a href="https://notionism.org" target="_blank">Notionism</a>. It explains what these technologies
        are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal information if we
        combine it with other information.
      </p>

      <h2>What are cookies?</h2>

      <p>
        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies
        are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as
        to provide reporting information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cookies set by the website owner are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website
        owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be
        provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set
        these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when
        it visits certain other websites.
      </p>

      <h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2>

      <p>
        We use first and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in
        order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other
        cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online
        Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This
        is described in more detail below.
      </p>

      <h2>How can I control cookies?</h2>

      <p>
        You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting
        your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which categories
        of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide
        you with services.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on our website. If you choose to reject
        cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be
        restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.
      </p>

      <p>
        The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our Website and the purposes they perform
        are described in the table below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the
        specific Online Properties you visit):
      </p>

      <h2>How can I control cookies on my browser?</h2>

      <p>

        should visit your browser's help menu for more information. The following is information about how to manage

      <h2>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h2>

      <p>
        Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar
        technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are
        tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our
        Website or opened an email including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users
        from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you
        have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site
        performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are
        reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
      </p>

      <h2>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h2>

      <p>
        Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other
        things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention, and for other site
        operations.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to
        block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the <a target="_BLANK"><a target="_blank"
                                                                                           rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                                                                           href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">Website
        Storage Settings Panel</a></a>. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the <a target="_BLANK"><a
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">Global
        Storage Settings Panel</a></a> and following the instructions (which may include instructions that
        explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site),
        how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8
        and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the
        time).
      </p>

      <p>
        Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede
        the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with
        our services or online content.
      </p>

      <h2>Do you serve targeted advertising?</h2>

      <p>
        Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Website.
        These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant
        advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is
        used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. They can accomplish this by using cookies or web beacons to
        collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about
        goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable
        us or them to identify your name, contact details, or other details that directly identify you unless you choose
        to provide these.
      </p>

      <h2>How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</h2>

      <p>
        We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies
        we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore revisit this Cookie Policy
        regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.
